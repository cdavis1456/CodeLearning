Example

/24 is only one (1) octet so 192.168.0.xxx 
a /16 is 192.168.xxx.xxx 
 
11111111.11111111.11111111.11111111

That is what describes a IPv4 address.

Recall that each 1 is a bit. Each set of eight bits is a byte. 


Assignment

I want you to write me a small python program that asks me how many addresses I need and then tells me the  best CIDR block number (/16, /24, /27, etc).

2 Assignment 

Once you figure that out, I want your output to also include an example range:

Your available IP addresses start at:
192.168.0.0

And end at:
192.168.0.127
